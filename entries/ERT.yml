  Prior to PCF 2.0, ERT was the name given to the tile in a PCF installation that represented the underlying CF deployment. 
  A limited set of configurations and defaults were exposed to platform operators through the OpsManager UI, resulting in 
  a friendlier installation and upgrade experience. ERT refers only to this specific branded Cloud Foundry.
