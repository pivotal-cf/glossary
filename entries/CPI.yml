headword: CPI

  BOSH makes it easy to deploy software to any cloud/IaaS, and even to various container
  runtimes like Docker, Kubernetes, and Garden.  There are several core implementations
  of the CPI, e.g. the vSphere CPI, but anyone can build their own.  A CPI implementation
  encapsulates the specifics of managing things like VMs/containers and disks so that the
  core of BOSH, as well as the software deployed by BOSH, can remain "IaaS-agnostic".
